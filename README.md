# Open-Kattis-Projects
Projects from Open Katiss that I have either completed or attempted

(4/8/2019) Created Repo will try to add all projects over the next 3 days

(4/9/2019) Added all current projects (completed and attempted) from Open Katiss.\
Next Task: Go through files and add in comments. Codes are relatively small and fairly easy to navigate, but for the sake of standards, I'm going to add comments.

(4/11/2019) Added more projects that I completed on the specified date.

(4/16/2019) Changed repository name to add some level protection/prevention (repository cannot be searched under Open Kattis tag) from others using my codes to complete Open Kattis projects.
